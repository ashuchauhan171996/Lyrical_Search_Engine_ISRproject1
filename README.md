# Lyrical_Search_Engine_ISRproject1
First hand experience building a text-based mini search engine.

# Goals of this Project
In this project I got first hand experience building a text-based mini search engine. In particular, there are three main learning objectives: 
* (i) the basics of tokenization (e.g. stemming, case-folding, etc.) and its effect on information retrieval; 
* (ii) basics of index building and Boolean retrieval; 
* (iii) basics of the Vector Space model and ranked retrieval.
