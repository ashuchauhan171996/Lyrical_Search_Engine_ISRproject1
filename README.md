# Lyrical_Search_Engine_ISRproject1
First hand experience building a text-based mini search engine.

# Goals of this Project
In this project I got first hand experience building a text-based mini search engine. In particular, there are three main learning objectives: 
* Basics of tokenization (e.g. stemming, case-folding, etc.) and its effect on information retrieval; 
* Basics of index building and Boolean retrieval; 
* Basics of the Vector Space model and ranked retrieval.
